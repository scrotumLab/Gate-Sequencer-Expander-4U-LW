BOM for SL15X - v2.0

Through hole components

• 21 x 1N4148

• 20 x SPDT on-off-on subminiature toggle switches (subminiature!).

• 1 x SPDT on-on subminiature toggle switch (subminiature!).

• 1 x push button momentary SPST-NO (off-on) switch.
The hole on the panel has a diameter of 12 mm. You can adapt in FrontDesign.

• 1 x rotary switch 1 Pole-10 Position
The hole on the panel has a diameter of 10 mm. You can adapt in FrontDesign. 
Easier to find a 1 Pole-12 Position like:

Warning: it can get tricky to mount the knob on the thread if this kind of switch!

Tayda has these too, but they are shorting: no connection turning the knob between 2 positions. https://www.taydaelectronics.com/rotary-switch-1-pole-10-position-alpha-sr2511-3599.html

• 10 x LEDs

• 10 x Red Lens for 3mm LED Low Profile SMB200RTP

• 15 x red banana plugs 530-108-0902-1

— 2 x 11mm spacers

• 2 x mini jumpers like this one:

• Pin headers male
- 1 x 40 pins
- 4 x 2 pins (or 2 x 2 pins in double row for reset jumpers)
- 2 x 1 pin

• Pin headers female 
- 1 x 40 pins
- 1 x 5 pins
- 2 x 4 pins
- 2 x 2 pins

A few tips:

HEADERS
All male pins go on the CGS89 board, except the 4 x 2 pins on the Expander board for the RESET option.
See my photos here if you have doubts on placing the headers:
https://batchas.com/scrotumLab/Scrotum-Lab-SL15X-Expander/Scrotum-Lab-SL15X-Expander.pdf

You’ll notice on my photos that I use 40 pins headers and I take out every second pin on the female header, so it fits the Expander. You don’t need to take every second pin out on the male of course.

For +VE and GND, I place female headers with 2 pins cause it’s more stable and easier to place a 2 pin female header than a 1 pin female header, but it’s only 1 male pin on the CGS board that goes to these 2 pins. See photo with red arrow.

SPACERS
Easier to place the spacers on the Expander before you mount it to the frontpanel.

ROTARY SWITCH
I’m giving a small mini-board to solder the switch on it, cause it’s easier to solder the switch pins to a board than to wires. Then it’s up to you how you want to connect this mini-board after to your Expander.

PANEL
I supply here the panel layout made in FrontDesign as open source project. FrontDesing is the tool I use to order aluminium frontpanels from Schaeffer AG in Germany.
The price I pay for one panel is:
51.50 EUR for the panel. Drilling & printing.
Shipping (to France) is 8.50 EUR
VAT is 19%
TOTAL 71.40 EUR for one panel.
